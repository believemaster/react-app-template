# React App Template
Clone or download this project to bootstrap a React project!

## Getting Started
Install the relevant ```node_modules``` and fire up the development server:

```npm i && npm run dev```

> If you want to start the react-project this is a simple starting up boilerplate for that.

**This React tempate is completly modified from the orignal react that is bootstrapped from from facebook react repository so as to reduce the time consumed to modify that project and start directly with the modules which are commonly used in project that is ```parcel``` and ```babel``` and other things.**
